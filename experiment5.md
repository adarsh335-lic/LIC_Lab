# Design question: Generate a pulse width of 0.5 ms using 555 IC.

## Abstract
This project involves the design and implementation of a pulse generator circuit using a triple IC-based configuration. The circuit is designed to produce a consistent and stable 0.5 millisecond pulse output. 
It utilizes an astable multivibrator to generate a square wave, which is then processed through a differentiator and a clipper stage to condition the signal for a monostable multivibrator. 
The final output is a well-defined pulse suitable for timing applications and triggering logic systems.

## Introduction
Pulse generators are essential components in digital and timing circuits. They are used in applications ranging from clock signal generation to triggering sequential logic elements. This report outlines the development of a pulse generator that produces a 0.5 ms pulse using discrete analog components and a sequence of three integrated circuits:

* Astable Multivibrator â€“ to generate a continuous square wave.

* Differentiator + Clipper â€“ to extract sharp triggering pulses from square wave transitions.

* Monostable Multivibrator â€“ to produce a single, timed output pulse on each trigger.

Working Principle
1. Astable Multivibrator
   
* Role: Continuously toggles between high and low states, generating a symmetrical square wave.

* IC Used: Commonly NE555 or a pair of transistors.

* Purpose: Acts as a free-running oscillator to generate timing signals.

3. Differentiator
   
* Role: Converts square wave transitions into sharp spikes (positive on rising edge, negative on falling edge).
  
* Type Used: High-pass RC circuit, where time constant Ï„ = RC is chosen to be significantly smaller than the period of the input square wave to produce narrow pulses.
  
* Function: Isolates transitions to generate triggering edges.

4. Clipper
   
* Role: Removes unwanted polarity spikes (typically negative spikes) that could falsely trigger the monostable.
  
* Configuration: Diode with reference voltage or clamping to ground.
  
* Purpose: Ensures only desired edge (e.g., positive) passes to the monostable input.

6. Monostable Multivibrator
   
* Role: Produces a single output pulse of a defined duration (here, 0.5 ms) in response to each trigger.
  
* IC Used: NE555 in monostable mode or equivalent.
  
* Trigger Condition: Needs a clean, fast falling-edge or rising-edge pulse to initiate the output.

## Working

- When the trigger pin (pin 2) receives a LOW signal (<1/3 Vcc), the timer starts timing.
- The output (pin 3) goes HIGH for the duration `T = 1.1RC`.
- After the time `T` elapses, the output returns to LOW.
- Re-triggering is only possible after the pulse ends.

## Output Waveform

Simulations were performed using a pulse source (`VTrig`) with varying parameters to test the monostable response.

###  Case 1: Properly Spaced Triggers

**Trigger Pulse Source:**
VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 2m)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 52 04_2cadc49e]

- Generates a falling edge every **2 ms**.
- Simulation Time: **10 ms**

**Expected Results:**

- Each falling edge successfully triggers the 555 timer.
- The output (`VOUT`) goes HIGH for ~0.5 ms per trigger.
- Multiple distinct output pulses are generated.

**Waveforms:**

1. **Trigger Input (VTrig)**: Periodic 2 ms LOW pulses.
2. **Capacitor Voltage (VC)**: Shows charge/discharge profile.
3. **Output (VOUT)**: Series of 0.5 ms HIGH pulses.

- Generates a falling edge every **0.2 ms** (faster than output duration).
- Simulation Time: **2 ms**

**Expected Results:**

- Only the **first falling edge** triggers the timer.

**Waveforms:**
1. **Trigger Input (VTrig)**: Fast repetitive pulses.
2. **Capacitor Voltage (VC)**: Single charge/discharge cycle.
3. **Output (VOUT)**: Single 0.5 ms HIGH pulse.

##  Theory

###  555 Timer in Astable Mode

- Generates continuous square wave (no external trigger required).
- Output oscillates between HIGH and LOW indefinitely.

Formulas:
- `T_ON = 0.693 Ã— (R1 + R2) Ã— C`
- `T_OFF = 0.693 Ã— R2 Ã— C`
- `T_PERIOD = T_ON + T_OFF`

###  555 Timer in Monostable Mode

- Generates a single output pulse of fixed duration on every trigger.
- Pulse width `T = 1.1 Ã— R Ã— C`

##  Calculations

#  555 Timer Astable Mode â€“ Pulse Width Configurations

This section describes different timing configurations using a 555 Timer in astable mode to generate specific `T_ON` and `T_OFF` durations. Each case uses the standard formula:

### Formulas Used

- \( T_{ON} = 0.693 \times (R1 + R2) \times C \)
- \( T_{OFF} = 0.693 \times R2 \times C \)
- \( T = T_{ON} + T_{OFF} \)
- \( f = \frac{1}{T} \)

Assume: \( C = 0.01 \mu F \) (fixed)

---

##  Case 1: `T_ON = 0.3 ms`, `T_OFF = 0.2 ms`

- **Total Period**: 0.5 ms  
- **Frequency**: 2 kHz

### Calculations:

- \( 0.3 = 0.693 \times (R1 + R2) \times 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \Rightarrow R1 + R2 \approx 43.26 \text{ kÎ©} \)
- \( 0.2 = 0.693 \times R2 \times 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \Rightarrow R2 \approx 28.87 \text{ kÎ©} \)
- â‡’ \( R1 \approx 14.39 \text{ kÎ©} \)

### Component Values Used:

- **R1 = 14.4 kÎ©**  
- **R2 = 28.9 kÎ©**  
- **C = 0.01 ÂµF**

---

##  Case 2: `T_ON = 0.7 ms`, `T_OFF = 0.3 ms`

- **Total Period**: 1.0 ms  
- **Frequency**: 1 kHz

### Calculations:

- \( 0.7 = 0.693 \times (R1 + R2) \times 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \Rightarrow R1 + R2 \approx 100.99 \text{ kÎ©} \)
- \( 0.3 = 0.693 \times R2 \times 0.01 \times 10^{-6} \Rightarrow R2 \approx 43.29 \text{ kÎ©} \)
- â‡’ \( R1 \approx 57.70 \text{ kÎ©} \)

### Component Values Used:

- **R1 = 57.6 kÎ©**  
- **R2 = 43.3 kÎ©**  
- **C = 0.01 ÂµF**

---

##  Case 3: `T_ON = 0.4 ms`, `T_OFF = 0.1 ms`, `T = 0.5 ms`

![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 53 47_69d26ff7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a09959e9-298a-4230-8987-634d2b1778af)

### Calculations:

- \( R1 + R2 \approx 57.69 \text{ kÎ©} \)  
- \( R2 \approx 14.43 \text{ kÎ©} \Rightarrow R1 \approx 43.26 \text{ kÎ©} \)

### Component Values Used:

- **R1 = 43.2 kÎ©**  
- **R2 = 14.4 kÎ©**  
- **C = 0.01 ÂµF**

---

##  Inverted Output

A transistor inverter (see *Figure 2*) was used to invert the waveform from Case 3:

- **Inverted T_ON**: 0.1 ms  
- **Inverted T_OFF**: 0.4 ms  

### Advantages of Inversion:

- Provides a **falling-edge** trigger signal suitable for monostable applications.
- Allows for **precise separation** between pulse events.
- Ensures **reliable reset and triggering** of downstream circuits.

##  Output Waveform Observations

###  Case 1 (T = 0.5 ms)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 53 11_10e9921b]!(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806c7d61-234c-48ee-ad3f-cf44efe010fd)


- Astable output toggles every 0.5 ms (0.3 ms ON, 0.2 ms OFF).
- Each falling edge triggers the monostable multivibrator.
- Monostable generates a **0.5 ms pulse** per trigger.
- Output waveform is a series of 0.5 ms pulses aligned with each trigger.

###  Case 2 (T = 1.0 ms)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 53 26_3e34c3b1]![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/789ec5bb-891e-4e27-9021-5d3fceb7fe97)
- Astable output toggles every 1.0 ms (0.7 ms ON, 0.3 ms OFF).
- Fewer trigger pulses due to slower frequency.
- Monostable output still maintains 0.5 ms pulse per trigger.

###  Case 3 (with inverter)

- Trigger pulse: `0.1 ms HIGH`, `0.4 ms LOW`
- Falling edges spaced by 0.5 ms
- Monostable has sufficient time to return to LOW before next pulse
