# INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER
### INTRODUCTION
  An instrumentation amplifier (or in-amp) is a type of differential amplifier designed to accurately amplify small differential signals in the presence of large common-mode voltages and noise. It is widely used in sensor signal conditioning, medical instrumentation, and data acquisition systems where precision and stability are critical.
  ### key features
  - High input impedance: Prevents loading of the signal source.

  - High common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR): Effectively rejects noise and interference common to both input lines.

  - Precise gain control: Gain can typically be adjusted with a single resistor.

  - Low output impedance: Good for driving loads or analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

### Applictions
  - Biomedical signal amplification (e.g., ECG, EEG)

  - Strain gauge and bridge sensor measurements (e.g presure,force,weight)

  - Industrial process control systems (e.g emperature, flow, or pressure monitoring using transducers).

### Basic structure
  - Basic structure of a instrumental amplifier consists of 3 opamp
  - Where 2 are the buffer amplifier and another one is a diffrential amplifier.
  - By connecting the resistor across the buffer amplifier we can control the overall gain of the amplifier
